# Lonely Pioneer: World Knowledge Base

This document defines the physical laws, biological needs, and economic requirements of the world. Treat these as absolute truths for planning.

## 1. Biological Systems

Agents must balance four core stats (0-100).

| Stat       | Decay Condition  | Recovery Method            | Result of 0          |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Health** | Food/Warmth is 0 | Time (Slow), Food (Varies) | **Permanent Death**  |
| **Food**   | 1.0 / minute     | Eating Berries, Meat       | Health Drains (-1/s) |
| **Warmth** | 2.0 / minute     | Campfires, Shelters        | Health Drains (-1/s) |
| **Energy** | Physical Action  | Resting (Idle)             | Action Speed Reduced |

## 2. The Environment

| Resource       | Yields  | Tools Needed       | Location               |
| :------------- | :------ | :----------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Tree**       | Wood    | None (Spear helps) | Scattered / Everywhere |
| **Rock**       | Stone   | None (Spear helps) | Scattered / Everywhere |
| **Berry Bush** | Berries | None               | Scattered / Everywhere |

## 3. Construction & Crafting

Building structures provides long-term survival advantages.

| Structure    | Cost              | Primary Benefit | Usage                                            |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Campfire** | 10 Wood, 3 Stone  | Active Warmth   | Stand within 5 units to gain +0.5 Warmth/s       |
| **Shelter**  | 50 Wood, 10 Stone | Passive Warmth  | Provides global warmth boost to nearby residents |
| **Spear**    | 5 Wood, 2 Stone   | Efficiency      | Increases harvest speed and damage               |

## 4. Consumables

| Item            | Food Restore | Other Effects         |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :-------------------- |
| **Berries**     | +15          | None                  |
| **Raw Meat**    | +20          | -5 Health (Parasites) |
| **Cooked Meat** | +40          | +5 Health             |

## 5. Survival Logic (Core Principles)

- **Preparation**: It is always better to have resources _before_ a stat becomes critical.
- **Infrastructure**: Buildings are more efficient than constant scavenging. A campfire is required to survive the night/cold.
- **Economy of Action**: Every movement costs Time. Grouping tasks (Gather -> Gather -> Build) is more efficient than frequent back-and-forth.
- **Death is Final**: Prioritizing Health is the ultimate goal.
